# Splunk-Data-Fabric-Integration-Sandbox
In an effort to assist Splunk customers to integrate with Hadoop, RDBMS, Kafka, Nifi and other software components, we developed Splunk Data Fabric Integration Sandbox virtual environment. The purpose of the Sandbox is to correlate the components that make up the Splunk data fabric embrace initiative process. The practitioners can now immediately try and experience the power of a Splunk integration with different external software components like Hadoop, RDBMS, Kafka and Nifi, with the ability to search, visualize and analyze the pre-populated data. There is no hassle of setting them up separately!
